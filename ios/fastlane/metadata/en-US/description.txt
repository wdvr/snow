Powder Chaser — Stop guessing. Start chasing.

Other apps tell you it snowed. We tell you if it's actually good. Our ML-powered snow quality algorithm analyzes 29 data points — from fresh powder depth to freeze-thaw cycles to wind conditions — to give you a simple answer: is it worth the drive?

WHY POWDER CHASER IS DIFFERENT
Most ski apps show snowfall numbers. But 10cm of snow means nothing if it fell on an ice layer, got wind-packed, or melted the next day. Powder Chaser tracks what actually matters:

• Fresh powder since the last thaw-freeze — not just total snowfall
• Real snow quality ratings from Excellent to Not Skiable
• ML-predicted quality scores trained on thousands of real conditions
• Multi-elevation analysis at base, mid, and summit

7-DAY SNOW QUALITY FORECAST
Plan your powder days with confidence. Our forecast doesn't just show snowfall predictions — it predicts actual snow quality for each day, so you can pick the best day to go.
