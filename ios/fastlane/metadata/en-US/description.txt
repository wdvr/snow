Powder Chaser - The Smart Way to Find Fresh Snow

Track real-time snow conditions at 28+ ski resorts worldwide with our proprietary snow quality algorithm. Unlike other apps, we don't just show snowfall - we track fresh powder since the last ice layer formed, so you know the actual skiing conditions before you go.
